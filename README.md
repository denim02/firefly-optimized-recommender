# firefly-optimized-recommender

To run this program, you must first install the following dependencies: numpy, cython, scikit-surprise, and seaborn
To do so (if you have pip installed), simply run:
 ```
    pip install {package-name} {--user (Only if normal installation produces an error)}
 ```

If pip cannot be found on your machine, first try executing:
```
    python -m pip install {package-name}    (or alternatively python3 -m pip ....)
```
    
If the same error occurs, then pip should first be installed on your computer.
